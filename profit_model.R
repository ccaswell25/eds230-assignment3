#Almond Profit Model

#you might assume a baseline profit and then adjust according to the anomaly  

#there are many ways to combine the almond yield and profit functions; you can have the profit function "call"/use the almond yield function; or create a wrapper function that calls them in sequence (first the almond yield and then the profit function)
